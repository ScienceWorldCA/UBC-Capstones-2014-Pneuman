The following are steps needed to set up the Pneuman Blackout Communicator in Nodel:

    1. Create new Nodel node named whatever you would like.
    2. Compile the S71200UrlCommunicators project. This project was created using the IntelliJ IDEA IDE so could be compiled using that.
    3. Copy the JAR file from out/artifacts/S71200URLCommunicators_jar.
    4. Place copied JAR file in top level of the Nodel node folder.
    5. Copy and paste contents of Resources folder to top level of the Nodel node folder. Replace any existing files of same name.
    6. (OPTIONAL) Add PLC certificate to trust store S71200TrustStore.store copied from Resources folder. The most recent certificate from 03/12/2015 is already included.
    7. Navigate to new node in Nodel UI and enter required information.

    Done!
